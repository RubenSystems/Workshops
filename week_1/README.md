# Week 1

First ever workshop. 

***Objective:*** 
- Learn tensorflow basics 
- Neural Nets 
- Deep Learning
- Using Tensorflow.js 
- Practical experience with machine learning

## Projects
- Basic Neural Networks 
- Neural networks with real data
- Deploying neural networks 

 
## Stages

***Day 1***
- Ensure environment works on everybody's computer 
- Learn neural network terminology (activation funcs, batch sizes, learning rates, training, testing, etc)
- Use the tensorflow sandbox to show all new stuff in action 

***Day 2***
- Learn about neural networks with examples
- Try with basic polynomial regression and classififcation
- See how different things affect neural networks (like above + ann structure (density and number of layers))

***Day 3***
- Create a neural network on real data
- Analysing the real data 
- Analysing the neural network 
- Creating predictions on the data 

***Day 4***
- Deploying the model
- Exporting model to a savable format
- Using the model in a website

***Day 5***
- Finish everything off 
- Time for questions
