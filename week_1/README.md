# Week 1

First ever workshop. 

***Objectives:*** 
- Learn tensorflow basics 
- Neural Nets 
- Deep Learning
- Using Tensorflow.js 
- Practical experience with machine learning
- Learning about autoencoders
- Using autoencoders to speed up other learning tasks 
- Intro to generative neural networks 

## Projects
- Basic Neural Networks 
- Neural networks with real data
- Deploying neural networks 
- Creating and training an autoencoder on the MNIST dataset
- Using the autoencoder's encoder block to help speed up discriminatave (classification) tasks 
- Using the autoencoder's decoder block to help speed up generation tasks
